Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody is looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

I want to used you and abused you
I want to know what's inside
Moving on hold your head
Moving on keep your head
Moving on hold your head
Moving on keep your head
Moving on hold your head
Moving on keep your head
Moving on
